            <p className="text-[#AAAAAA] text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
              After a decade in email marketing, I&apos;ve seen the same frustrations over and over. Even at major enterprise companies with sophisticated marketing automation platforms like Eloqua and Marketo, creating beautiful, on-brand emails is still unnecessarily complex.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#AAAAAA] text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Teams either struggle with limited drag-and-drop editors that don&apos;t give them real control, or they need developers to hand-code every template from scratch. Recently, I applied for a role where the job requirement was literally &quot;must know how to code email templates from scratch&quot; â€“ and that convinced me more than ever that we need a better solution.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#AAAAAA] text-lg leading-relaxed">
              There had to be a middle ground: professional-grade design control without needing to be a developer.

            <div className="space-y-4 text-[#AAAAAA] leading-relaxed">
              <p>
                I started my career in sales, but quickly realized my passion was in marketing and technology. I taught myself HTML and CSS, which opened the door to campaign operations and eventually email marketing leadership.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the past decade, I&apos;ve built complex email nurture programs, managed deliverability for enterprise companies, and led teams that send millions of emails. I&apos;ve worked with platforms ranging from basic drag-and-drop editors to sophisticated enterprise automation tools.
              </p>
              <p>
                At one company, we were fortunate enough to have developers build us a custom email editor. It was incredible â€“ but I knew that level of control shouldn&apos;t require a development team.
              </p>
              <p>
                As I advanced to Director of Email Marketing, I realized I could either keep complaining about the tools, or I could build the solution I wished existed.
